 content is created without any defined owner or leader, 
and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually
 allow content to be written using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[2] 
There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. S
ome wiki engines are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access);
 for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access
 control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.
